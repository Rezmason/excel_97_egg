### How to Fly

**On pointer-equipped devices:** move your pointer to
control your heading, left-click and right-click to accelerate and
decelerate, and hold the spacebar to brake. You can also scroll down
the credits the way you scroll down a conventional web page.

**On touch-enabled devices:** use one finger to control
your heading, and hold another at the top, bottom, or middle of the
screen to accelerate, decelerate or brake.
