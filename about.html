								Hiding things in your work for people to find is known as an

								Shrewdly in their downtime, because some people are just fun.
							</p>

							<p>
								Big programs took a very long time to compile, test and
								stabilize back in the nineties. While they waited, Microsoft's
								software&nbsp;developers pranked each other, learned to juggle,
								and made their own games with the new tools at their disposal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some games got

									target="_blank"

									>bundled with Windows</a
								>
								or sold in
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack"
									>"Entertainment Packs"</a
								>. Others stowed away in published software as easter&nbsp;eggs.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my opinion, this specific easter&nbsp;egg was how someone
								taught themselves to use
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface"

								Glenn Corpes used to efficiently render 3D terrain and water.

							<p>
								It can be considered a followup to Excel&nbsp;95's
								Doom&#8209;inspired easter&nbsp;egg,
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://archive.org/details/microsoft-office-95-hall-of-tortured-souls"
									>"Hall&nbsp;of&nbsp;Tortured&nbsp;Souls"</a
								>. The two have some minor things in common, though they're
								rendered very differently.
							</p>
							<p>
								Microsoft didn't mind any of this at the time, as long as the
								easter&nbsp;eggs weren't directly linked to the main program.
								That might've given the company some cover in case a
								PR&nbsp;disaster struck. It also meant the authors had to work
								out how to load and run the easter&nbsp;egg code without
								referencing it— by overwriting a function pointer when certain
								keys were held down at once, for instance.
							</p>
							<p>
								Redmond's lenience wouldn't last. Its

								>
								in 2002 prescribed major changes to how its developers wrote
								software, making a program's user productivity, stability and
								security paramount— which in turn made easter&nbsp;eggs
								unshippable.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, software easter&nbsp;eggs are almost unheard of outside
								the game industry.

							<p>I'm so glad you asked!</p>
							<p>
								To
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering"
									>reverse&nbsp;engineer</a
								>
								the original program, its memory was recorded with
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump"
								>
									ProcDump</a
								>
								as it ran on Windows&nbsp;XP in
								<a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"
									>Virtual&nbsp;Box</a
								>. Memory snapshots were inspected and compared with
								<a target="_blank" href="https://hexfiend.com/">Hex Fiend</a>.
								The credit&nbsp;text, terrain&nbsp;data, framebuffer and
								textures were recovered this way. A custom Win32 program was
								written to collect the color&nbsp;lookup&nbsp;table, which the
								project uses in indexed&#8209;color mode. Larger
								True&#8209;Color textures were custom made in Photoshop.
							</p>
							<p>
								Several small details, like the key bindings and
								text&nbsp;formatting, were found with a decompiler; others, such
								as the dithering technique, were discovered by analyzing
								framebuffers in Photoshop. Lastly, the framebuffers were fed
								into <a target="_blank" href="https://fspy.io">fSpy</a> to
								recover the camera properties and the player's starting position
								and rotation.
							</p>
							<p>
								A prototype was built in
								<a target="_blank" href="https://threejs.org">Three.js</a>
								before this more detailed port was made in
								<a target="_blank" href="http://regl.party">regl</a>. The
								controls, data&nbsp;parser, renderer and shaders were all custom
								made and updated over time to recapture the original experience.

							<h2>Torus Trap</h2>
							<img id="heightmap" src="assets/ui/heightmap_colorized.png" />
							<p>
								Notice the landscape repeats in every direction, so you can fly
								forever. In fact this whole world is "charted" from a square
								"spreadsheet"
								<em>only 64 cells wide.</em>
							</p>
							<p>So, how is it so easy to get lost?</p>
							<p>
								There are a few tricks to make small worlds feel big. Provide no
								navigational instruments or vantage&nbsp;points; give the world
								a uniform texture and few distinct landmarks; the short drawing
								distance hides the terrain's repetition; and in fact, many of
								its features loop around the edge of the world to join back with
								themselves, so there's no visible seam.
							</p>
							<p>
								Above all, the camera is tightly zoomed in, with a
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view"
								>
									field of view</a
								>
								of only <em>26&nbsp;degrees</em>. That's like piloting a plane
								through a porthole the size of a dinner plate two feet in front
								of your face. Of course you're lost. Relish it.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section id="lighting">
							<h2>Behind the Sheens</h2>
							<p>
								Rapid lighting and texturing are the enduring pillars of 3D
								graphics cards, but in the nineties most Excel users and even
								gamers didn't have those. Rendering was done in software, not
								hardware, and making something look good and draw fast while
								running on a Pentium was a real challenge.
							</p>
							<p>
								A common way to light things quickly is to only do it once,
								ahead of time. This is called "pre&#8209;computed" or "baked"
								lighting, and while we bake data into special textures nowadays,
								back then it was common to bake to <em>vertices</em>, which are
								the points that define shapes.
							</p>
							<p>
								The easter&nbsp;egg's terrain data is like a baked lasagna— the
								elevation, lighting, and material of each point is baked into a
								corresponding 64x64 grid.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's clear just by looking at them that the lighting data was
								created from the elevation data, but it's not a realistic
								lighting calculation. Instead, like an early form of
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion"
									>ambient occlusion</a
								>, the pointy areas were made darker than the smooth ones, which
								is <em>also</em> like a baked lasagna.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section id="stripes">
							<h2>Earning Their Stripes</h2>
							<img id="palette" src="assets/ui/palette.png" />
							<p>
								By default, this simulator draws with only the original 256
								colors, which took some effort. It has to load the
								color&nbsp;lookup&nbsp;table and indexed&#8209;color textures
								into video&nbsp;memory, and its shaders map texel values to
								colors in the table, like an old VGA
								<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMDAC"
									>RAMDAC</a
								>.
							</p>
							<p>
								That table holds sixteen shades of sixteen colors, so most
								pixels get mapped to the same shade as their neighbors, causing
								a visual artifact known as
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding"
									>banding</a
								>. A technique called
								<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither"
									>dithering</a
								>
								can hide banding by adjusting pixel values with random noise or
								high frequency patterns.
							</p>
							<p>
								The original easter&nbsp;egg draws terrain one triangle at a
								time, using
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanline_rendering"
									>scanline rendering</a
								>. A scanline is a row of pixels drawn left to right. Each
								pixel's final color and texture depends on its distance from the
								scanline edges. This code is where the authors chose to add very
								simple dithering. That skews the dither pattern along the
								triangle edges, but it inexpensively doubles the range of the
								terrain shading from sixteen to thirty&#8209;two.
							</p>
							<p>
								Graphics hardware doesn't render using scanlines, but this
								project simulates them. Its vertex&nbsp;shader maps each
								triangle's left edges to a skewed space, and the
								fragment&nbsp;shader offsets the dither of each pixel by the
								<a
									target="_blank"
									href="http://localhost:8000/?o=c&interactive=false&l=poolside&demo=scanlines"
									>distance along its scanline</a
								>. The result is subtle, but accurate.
