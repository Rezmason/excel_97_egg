					<h2>What is all this?</h2>
					<p>
						Artists and craftspeople often leave their mark on what they make.
						Programmers are no different.
					</p>
					<p>
						The basic flight&nbsp;simulator you see here is an example of an
						<a target="_blank" href="https://eeggs.com/items/718.html"
							>"easter&nbsp;egg"</a
						>— a game, image, sound, or written message hidden in a creative
						work, which in this case is
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#Excel_97_(v8.0)"
							>Microsoft&nbsp;Excel&nbsp;97</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Users who performed a secret combination of actions in an empty
						spreadsheet were taken to a whole new world created by members of
						Excel's "Charting&nbsp;Team", where a scrolling stele glorifies the
						application and credits everyone who worked on it.
					</p>
					<p>
						It hid in every copy of Excel&nbsp;97 ever sold, whether you knew it
						or not.
					</p>
					<h2>How and why did they hide it there?</h2>
					<p>
						With alacrity, wit, guile, and a healthy defiance of authority, I
						imagine. Let me go ask them. Here's what I know so far:
					</p>
					<p>
						In the eighties and nineties, Microsoft's software&nbsp;developers
						had a lot of time on their hands while their large projects compiled
						or underwent months of testing and stabilization. Many games
						Microsoft later bundled with Windows or sold in
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack"
							>"Entertainment Packs"</a
						>
						were originally the side&nbsp;projects of developers learning new
						APIs and showing off to one another in their downtime. Some of them
						chose to use their projects to secretly shine a spotlight on the
						teams they worked on. Whether these secrets were ever discovered was
						beside the point.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my opinion, this flight&nbsp;simulator easter&nbsp;egg began as
						someone's project to learn
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface"
							>GDI</a
						>
						and
						<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw"
							>DirectDraw</a
						>, and took inspiration from the techniques used in
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator"
							>Microsoft Flight&nbsp;Simulator</a
						>
						and maybe the setting of
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights"
						>
							One Thousand and One Nights</a
						>, filtered through the lens of
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)"
							>Disney's <em>Aladdin</em></a
						>. In fact, this is probably a
						<strong>magic carpet simulator</strong>, with controls simpler than
						any flight&nbsp;sim, no cockpit or instrument&nbsp;panel, and a
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias#Text"
							>monolith in a desolate landscape</a
						>
						recording an epic triumph.
					</p>
					<p>
						It can be considered a followup to the Excel&nbsp;95
						easter&nbsp;egg,
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://archive.org/details/microsoft-office-95-hall-of-tortured-souls"
							>"Hall&nbsp;of&nbsp;Tortured&nbsp;Souls"</a
						>, and they have a couple things in common, though they're rendered
						with very different techniques.
					</p>
					<p>
						Astonishingly, from Excel's first version through the nineties,
						Microsoft developers
						<em>were allowed to add easter&nbsp;eggs to products</em>, as long
						as they weren't directly referenced from the main application. That
						stipulation might've given the company some cover in case a
						PR&nbsp;disaster struck. It also meant the authors needed to work
						out a clever way to load and run the easter&nbsp;egg without
						referencing it— by overwriting a function pointer when certain keys
						were held down at once, for instance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside the game industry, this leniency toward easter&nbsp;eggs is
						almost extinct today. Originally, most industries and consumers
						weren't suspicious of the code in applications, but as software
						vulnerabilities made more headlines, developers faced mounting
						pressure to leave out any surprises that could compromise a user's
						productivity, stability or security. Microsoft's response, a 2002
						campaign called the
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020405060312/http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,49826,00.html"
							>"Trustworthy&nbsp;Computing&nbsp;Initiative"</a
						>, prescribed major changes to how the company wrote software, which
						in turn made easter&nbsp;eggs impossible to ship.
					</p>
					<h2>What's it doing here?</h2>
					<p>
						This web port aims to be a
						<strong>faithful&nbsp;reproduction</strong> of the original
						easter&nbsp;egg, and to preserve computer history. Web-based
						experiences have very few barriers to entry, so more people can
						marvel at what a small team of imaginative programmers managed to
						once conceal in the world's foremost spreadsheet application.
					</p>
					<p>
						The project is
						<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Rezmason/excel_97_egg"
							>fully open source</a
						>
						and
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://github.com/Rezmason/excel_97_egg/blob/main/LICENSE"
						>
							MIT licensed</a
						>, and has taught me many things.
					</p>
					<h2>How do you make an old easter&nbsp;egg into a website?</h2>
					<a target="_blank" href="assets/ui/palette_larger.png"
						><img id="palette" src="assets/ui/palette.png" />
					</a>
					<p>
						First you have to examine and recover information from it, which is
						called
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering"
						>
							"reverse&nbsp;engineering"</a
						>. Then you have to write a lot of JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						To reverse&nbsp;engineer the original program, its memory was
						recorded with
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump"
						>
							ProcDump</a
						>
						as it ran on Windows&nbsp;XP in
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"
							>Virtual&nbsp;Box</a
						>, and the hex&nbsp;dumps were compared and inspected with
						<a target="_blank" href="https://hexfiend.com/">Hex Fiend</a>. The
						credit&nbsp;text, terrain&nbsp;data, framebuffer and
						indexed&#8209;color textures were recovered this way. A custom Win32
						program was written to collect the 8&#8209;bit
						color&nbsp;lookup&nbsp;table, which is used in indexed&#8209;color
						mode. Several small details, like the original key bindings and
						text&nbsp;formatting, were found with a decompiler; others, such as
						the brightness dithering technique, were discovered in an analysis
						of the framebuffer in Photoshop. Lastly, camera properties and the
						starting position and rotation were recovered from the framebuffer
						with a great free tool called
						<a target="_blank" href="https://fspy.io">fSpy</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						A simple, earlier port of the easter&nbsp;egg was thrown together in
						<a target="_blank" href="https://threejs.org">Three.js</a>, before
						this more detailed port was made in
						<a target="_blank" href="http://regl.party">regl</a>.
						Of&nbsp;course, neither of these modern graphics APIs reproduced the
						flight&nbsp;simulator out&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;box. The controls,
						the data&nbsp;parser, the renderer and the shaders were all made and
						updated over time to load in more reformatted data from the
						original, transform it into something that looks the same, and
						present it in a way that feels the same.
					</p>
					<p>
						For instance, the original program can only display 256 specific
						colors onscreen. Modern graphics systems support millions of colors,
						so the original textures converted to a modern direct&#8209;color
						would have too high color&nbsp;depth. Instead, this project loads
						the indexed&#8209;color textures straight into video&nbsp;memory,
						along with the entire color&nbsp;lookup&nbsp;table, and the shaders
						map the color indices in the texels to colors in the table, like how
						computers used to do it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another good example is the baked&nbsp;vertex&nbsp;lighting. Modern
						renderers that can't afford to compute lighting for every pixel use
						<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightmap"
							>lightmaps</a
						>
						to render light and shadow across stationary objects. The
						easter&nbsp;egg uses an older technique: it assigns a precomputed
						light value to each vertex, and
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading"
						>
							blends between them</a
						>
						to look smooth. The busy textures the authors chose also help hide
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="http://localhost:8000/?o=c&interactive=false&l=spikes&demo=shading"
							>the coarseness of the lighting data</a
						>, even at
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="http://localhost:8000/?o=c&interactive=false&l=spikes"
							>higher resolutions</a
						>.
					</p>
					<h2>Why is it clunky? And what do the buttons do?</h2>
					<p>
						Computers were clunky in 1997, but you can change it in the options:

					<h2>Torus Trap</h2>
					<a target="_blank" href="assets/ui/utf16.png"
						><img id="heightmap" src="assets/ui/heightmap_colorized.png" />
					</a>
					<p>
						After a minute of flying, it'll dawn on you that the landscape loops
						around— you can fly forever in any direction, and the ground just
						repeats. Surprisingly, this whole world— its elevation, brightness
						and region data— is "charted" from a square "spreadsheet"
						<em>only 64 cells wide.</em>
					</p>
					<p>And here it is. So, how is it so easy to get lost?</p>
					<p>
						Several design decisions are at play here. There are no navigational
						instruments or vantage&nbsp;points; the world has the same texture
						almost everywhere; the terrain has few landmarks to help you get
						your bearings; the short drawing distance hides the terrain's
						repetition; and in fact, many of its features loop around the edge
						of the world to join back with themselves, so there's no detectable
						seam.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most importantly, the camera is tightly zoomed in, with a
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view"
						>
							field of view</a
						>
						of only around <em>26&nbsp;degrees</em>. That is like seeing the
						world through a porthole the size of a dinner plate held two feet
						from your face. So of course you're lost. Relish it.
					</p>
					<h2>Earning Their Stripes</h2>
					<p>
						If you squint at the terrain in indexed&#8209;color mode, you'll
						find pixelated streaks here and there. That's a part of the authors'
						lighting technique. Their limited color palette gave them only
						sixteen shades for the apparent brightness of each terrain pixel,
						but by
						<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither"
							>dithering</a
						>
						some areas with the two closest shades, they essentially doubled
						their color&nbsp;depth to thirty-two shades, and hid banding
						artifacts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most dithering techniques don't produce these cool streaks, but they
						appear here because the authors wrote it into their rasterizer— the
						code that draws the pixels that make up a shape. Old rasterizers
						would
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanline_rendering"
							>draw each row of pixels</a
						>
						from left to right. In the easter&nbsp;egg, the shades alternate
						along the way, creating repeating lines that run parallel to the
						shape's left edge. <em>Alakazam!</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Modern rasterizers don't work this way anymore, but this project
						pretends they do. The vertex&nbsp;shader finds the leftmost edges of
						a given triangle, and the fragment&nbsp;shader can measure
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="http://localhost:8000/?o=c&interactive=false&l=poolside&demo=scanlines"
							>the fragment's distance to its row's left end</a
						>, which is all that's needed to recreate the streak effect. Well,
						that and a peculiar attention to detail. But working it all out was
						a fun challenge, and considering you've read this far, it was worth
						it.
