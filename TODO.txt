Interview and technical explanation

Handbrake
	Holding down space stops all motion and sets the roll to zero
Improve mobile controls
	Integrate turn speed somehow
Improve platform lighting
Improve the pool lighting?
	Plug the extreme vertices into the lighting function
Is the spawn point and angle correct?
Smarter texture filtering to reduce aliasing
