Indexed color game plan
	Reproduce the reference frame's brightness index components
		Simplify brightness value for debugging purposes
		Use x = int(floor(x * c) / c) to sort values into sixteen buckets
			Maybe fifteen, you be the judge
		Then stripe it
			Change c to c*2
			Every other fragment should ceil instead of floor
				For now, "every other fragment" uses gl_FragCoord.x
			Then * 0.5 before the int
		Change "every other fragment" to (distance to start of raster) % 2
			Something something corners barycenters

		Don't stripe it if you're too close to the edge of a quad
			You've already got quad border math, just use it again
		Revisit the brightness and fog calculation in BOTH vertex shaders
	Grid and spotlight can stay as they are, if they still look good
	And make this stuff data driven
		Including whatever got added to the shaders
	And consider changing the icons
		What about their labels? What about the URL params? Hope that's a non-issue
	Recolor everything, you moron.
		Base it on the loaded palette
			Load this first; move colorLookupTable out of the texture packs
			Bonus: if someone drags and drops a diferent palette in, change the palette and update everything downstream
		The reference texture colors should be the last column in the corrected palette.
			Recolor the stele text
			Recolor the high res textures
			Recolor the the about banner
			Recolor the icons, maybe. Jeez louise.
	Now test all permutations, comparing before and after side by side
	And update the essay
	Merge branch

Atlas the textures, instead of whichTexture
The shaders could probably be cleaned up a bit

Spherical distortion could be neat
	How do those Minecraft shaders do it?
