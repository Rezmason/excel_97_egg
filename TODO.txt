Try adding a carpet, obviously

Indexed colors demo (extends color palette image)
	Mousing over or tapping the pixels in a test image highlight the pixel in the color palette
		(with Excel 97's version of the marching ants marquee)

Custom palette support
	indexed color BMP file (color table)
	16x16 BMP file (image pixels)
	Merveilles theme (generated)
	ACT file

Magic Carpet terrain?
Drop-in heightmap, empty region data, compute lighting the old way
Procedural terrain?
