Clean up code
	Move as many magic numbers as is sensible into data
	Is there a simpler operation to perform to append forward motion?
		Maybe composing a matrix and then transforming the position?
	It's weird that the terrain has a current quad
		It should return the current quad data, and the control module should expose it to the renderer
	Isolate the renderer from the main module
	Load the shaders in
	Review the shader code
Compare with reference some more

		Running the egg in virtualization
		Whittling down the scope (DLL deletion, etc)
		Memory dump comparison
		Data and texture extraction
		Reference images/video and observations
	ThreeJS process
		Build off of terrain example
		(look at git history for the rest)
	regl process
		Reduce the ThreeJS project to a reference
		Set up a basic render pipeline for textured geometries
		Build out zoned terrain that separates geometry into quads with centroids
		Expand shader support for water and scrolling, fading credit texture
		Teleport centroids to airplane position
		Work out the math for positioning and rotating the scene
		Replace ThreeJS-based math from old controls module with glMatrix operations
		Wire up horizon position and rotation to controls
		Add "bird's eye view" to help illustrate how the demo works
		Test touch controls

Interview and technical explanation

Add handbrake to controls
	Holding down space stops all motion and sets the roll to zero
Improve mobile controls
	Integrate turn speed somehow
Procedural terrain
Smarter texture filtering to reduce aliasing?
"SINDOGS" tribute?
	Maybe sine wave sundogs
