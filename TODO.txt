Now

	Find a way to assign a brightness to each vertex
		Base it on some sort of vertex normal dot product

	Create separate static meshes
		horizon (done)
		monolith platform
		scrolling text surface
		pool
		ground

	Scrolling text material
		Vertex shader adjusts UVs by mod of time, offset by vertex attribute
		Fragment shader colors the text based on UV and palette uniforms

	Pool material
		Vertex shader adjusts marked vertices by sine of time

	"Collision"
		Limit y position to the height of the ground where the camera is and maybe right in front of it
			Interpolate between points
			Remember to take the looping position into account
				modulo all positions to be as close to the player as possible

Later
	Shadows?

	Replace pool with ocean or water
