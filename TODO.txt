Indexed color game plan
	Cut a branch
	Lower the resolution, if necessary, for debug purposes
	Create indexed color textures as indexed BMPs
		Create 64x64 indexed color BMPs
		Set their palettes to the colors in the second-to-last column of the full palette
		Paste in the image data, it ought to look correct
		Load them in as files, grab the array buffer from their responses and create indexed textures
			REGL ought to support making textures from arrays of numbers
	Add 16x16 color palette texture PNG to the project
	Duplicate the render pass
		One is true color - pass it high resolution PNG textures
		The other is indexed color - pass it indexed textures
	Pass the palette texture into the indexed color fragment shader
	Reproduce the reference frame's texture index components
		Should just be the ordinary texture lookup
	Map the indices to the color palette
		Should look like an unlit ordinary terrain
	Reproduce the reference frame's brightness index components
		Simplify brightness value for debugging purposes
		Use x = int(floor(x * c) / c) to sort values into sixteen buckets
			Maybe fifteen, you be the judge
		Then stripe it
			Change c to c*2
			Every other fragment should ceil instead of floor
				For now, "every other fragment" uses gl_FragCoord.x
			Then * 0.5 before the int
		Change "every other fragment" to (distance to start of raster) % 2
			Something something corners barycenters

		Don't stripe it if you're too close to the edge of a quad
			You've already got quad border math, just use it again
		Revisit the brightness and fog calculation in BOTH vertex shaders
	Grid lines should index the magenta colors along the right edge of the palette
	You can still lerp the spotlight if it still looks good
	Now do the horizon
	And make this stuff data driven
		Including whatever got added to the shaders
	And consider changing the icons
		What about their labels? What about the URL params? Hope that's a non-issue
	Now test all permutations, comparing before and after side by side
	And update the essay
	Merge branch
