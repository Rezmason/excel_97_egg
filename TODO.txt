UI fixes
	Reorder the toolbar
	Maybe rename lighting cutoff to draw distance

Replace repo screenshot

Flowchart of data recovery
	Create outline
	Draw it out and find an old program to create it in
		Micrografx Flowcharter
		Old Visio

Spherical distortion in vertex shader ("trick to fake a sphere")
	Alan Wright added it to Populous: The Beginning
	How do PtB / Topia do it?
		A similar effect appears in Tetrisphere
		"Warped through like a fisheye lens"

ATI TruForm type tesselation option, aka NPatches
	N for Normals

Try adding a carpet, obviously

Indexed colors demo (extends color palette image)
	Mousing over or tapping the pixels in a test image highlight the pixel in the color palette
		(with Excel 97's version of the marching ants marquee)

Custom palette support
	indexed color BMP file (color table)
	16x16 BMP file (image pixels)
	Merveilles theme (generated)
	ACT file

Magic Carpet terrain?
Drop-in heightmap, empty region data, compute lighting the old way
Procedural terrain?

Interview a charting team member already!

Improve brightness computation
	It seems like geometry has lower brightness but greater contrast in relation to distance
	It seems more dramatic in the original
