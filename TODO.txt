Custom material
	Custom vertex attributes, loaded from JSON
		float brightness (zero for now)
		int textureToUse
		bool isWater
	Text color 1 and 2 uniforms
	Time uniform (threejs might already have one)

	Scrolling text
		Vertex shader adjusts UVs by mod of time
		Fragment shader colors the text based on UV and palette uniforms

	Find a way to assign a brightness to each vertex
		Base it on some sort of vertex normal dot product
		Bake it into the vertex attributes

"Collision"
	Limit y position to the height of the ground where the camera is and maybe right in front of it
		Interpolate between points
		Remember to take the looping position into account
			modulo all positions to be as close to the player as possible

Mobile
	alternative controls
		pan by clicking and dragging
		change speed by pressing and holding above or below midline
